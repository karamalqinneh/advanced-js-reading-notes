# Hashtables :

concepts and Terminology :

- Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
- Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
- Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

### Example

Let’s say we have data of Seattle neighborhood names and their corresponding zip codes. Now, we want to be able to search through the data to look up a neighborhood and obtain it’s zip code. We could do this using a for loop that looks through each piece of data one by one until it finds the neighborhood name, then returns the zip code there. This would be an O read operation because it requires searching through each piece of data to find the one piece we want.

The reason why searching for a piece of data in a collection is O isn’t because the array is slow, it’s just that we have to look through all N things in the collection. Instead of adding elements to an array from beginning to end, a hash map uses a «hash function» to place each item at a precise index location, based off it’s key.

## Why do we use Hashtable?

1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library

## Structure

### Hashing :

A hash code basically converts a key into an integer. The fact that hash codes are deterministic is crucial: their output is determined solely by their input. Randomness should never be used in hash codes. The hash code generated by the same key should always be the same.

### Creating a Hash

Traditionally, a hashtable is built from an array. Size 1024 can be used. This is crucial for index positioning. Make some form of logic to convert that "key" into a numeric number value after you've constructed your array of the suitable size. Here's something to consider:

- Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
- Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
- Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
- Insert into the array at that index.

#### Example:

```js

Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16.
```

Our key Cat now corresponds to index 16 in the array. We may rapidly look through this index and discover "Josie," our value.

### Collisions

When more than one key hashes to the same index in an array, a collision occurs. A "perfect hash" will never have any collisions, as previously stated. To put this in context, the worst conceivable hash is one that hashes every single key to the same exact array index. The more keys hashed to a specific index, the more key/value pair combinations you can have.

What would happen if two distinct keys resolved to the same array index? This is referred to as a collision. Two keys resolving to the same index must be handled by the hash map.

If two keys ever resolve to the same index, then two calls to will be required. Different keys would overwrite each other in Add(key, val).
