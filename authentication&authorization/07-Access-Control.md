# Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented in what files/routes you have access to based on your role, in other words rights are associated with roles not users.

## Perks of using RBAC:

1. Dynamic systems: you dont have to change access settings or policies when a certain user is no longer available.
2. When adding a new user you don't have to repeat yourself (yourcode) you simply assign them a predefined role.
